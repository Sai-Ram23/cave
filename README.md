CAVE (Color Analysis and Visualization Environment) is an innovative interactive color analysis and visualization system designed to revolutionize the way users perceive, detect, and explore colors in both static and dynamic visual contexts. Leveraging advanced computer vision, machine learning, and color theory, CAVE provides a comprehensive and intuitive tool for color analysis, catering to a wide range of artistic, technical, and research purposes.

Traditional color selection and identification tools often lack multi-level interaction capabilities, limiting their applicability across diverse use cases. CAVE addresses this gap by offering a cutting-edge platform that combines image processing algorithms, machine learning for color matching, and a responsive graphical user interface (GUI). This system empowers users to identify, understand, and explore colors with precision and creativity, making it an ideal tool for designers, researchers, and anyone engaged in visual studies.
